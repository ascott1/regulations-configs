# regulations-configs

[eRegulations](http://cfpb.github.io/eRegulations) is a web-based tool that makes regulations easier to find, read and understand with features such as inline official interpretations, highlighted defined terms, and a revision comparison view.

eRegs is made up of three core components:

* [regulations-parser](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser): Parse regulations
* [regulations-core](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-core): Regulations API
* [regulations-site](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-site): Display the regulations

This repository contains configuration related specifically to parsing [CFPB's
regulations](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/eregulations/) with 
[regulations-parser](https://github.com/cfpb/regulations-parser). These
configuration files can also be used as examples in cases unrelated to
CFPB's regulations.

## Using these files

The contents of these files should be included in the regulations-parser
`local_settings.py` files as needed for each regulation.
